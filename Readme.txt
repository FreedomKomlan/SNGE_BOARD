# SNGE_BOARD
This for SNGE Project
I'm building a board to measure some electrical parameters
The three first parameters are AC triphasis Voltage (V1, V2, V3) of 230 V		#3 AN
The second ones are the AC Current 						#3 AN
The frequency of the electrical network 					#1 AN
Two DC Voltage (One of 130, the other one is 127 V)				#2 AN
Two DC Current 								#2 AN
Analogic Temperature							#1 AN
Tout ou Rien Temperature							#1 D
Two Tout ou Rien input							#2 D
An output connected to alarm device						#1 O
A RS232 Interface for data communication to a PC				#RS232 UART
